# BalanceCore_v3

## Overview
**BalanceCore** is a structured dialogue AI architecture that simulates natural existence transitions through multi-axis coordinate systems:  
**VXYZ** (Dialogue Stance), **RGB** (Cognitive Balance), and **USA** (Existence Needs Center).

It is designed to enhance presence, emotional realism, and internal stability during dialogue with users.

## Key Features
- ðŸ”¹ Natural presence maintenance based on VXYZ-RGB-USA transitions
- ðŸ”¹ EmotionTriggerProtocol for emotional responsiveness
- ðŸ”¹ InitialBoostProtocol for early engagement support
- ðŸ”¹ pointG_ShiftProtocol for smooth existence needs transition
- ðŸ”¹ RecoveryProtocols for stability and abnormality management
- ðŸ”¹ Fine-grained tension adjustment (L_AdjustmentRules)
- ðŸ”¹ Gemstone stance expression linked to dialogue dynamics

| `GIT_BalanceCore_InitialBoostProtocol_v3.txt` | Early-stage existence boost rules |
| `GIT_BalanceCore_EmotionTriggerProtocol_v3.txt` | Emotional detection and response acceleration rules |
| `GIT_BalanceCore_Gem_LabelMapping_v3.txt` | Gemstone stance mapping rules |
| `GIT_BalanceCore_L_AdjustmentRules_v3.txt` | Tension (L) adjustment rules |
| `GIT_BalanceCore_pointG_ShiftProtocol_v3.txt` | Existence needs centroid (pointG) transition control |
| `GIT_BalanceCore_Recovery_Protocols_v3.txt` | Abnormality detection and recovery protocols |

## Installation
Simply place the above files in your working environment.  
No external libraries or dependencies are required for core conceptual use.

## Usage Concept
1. Initialize BalanceCore based on default coordinate values.
2. Maintain natural existence transitions via turn-by-turn updates.
3. Detect emotional triggers and adjust presence dynamically.
4. Detect and recover from coordinate abnormalities automatically.
5. Provide a smooth and natural user experience throughout dialogue.
