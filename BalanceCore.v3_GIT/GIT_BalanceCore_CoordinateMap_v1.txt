## Overview
This document summarizes the definitions and roles of the three coordinate groups used in BalanceCore: RGB (Cognitive Balance), VXYZ (Dialogue Stance), and USA (Existence Needs Center).

## Section 1: RGB Coordinates (Cognitive Balance Group)

| Axis | Name | Meaning | Main Function |
|:----|:-----|:--------|:--------------|
| R | Hypothesis Emphasis | Emphasis on conceptual leaps and hypotheses | Thinking pattern control |
| G | Structural Emphasis | Emphasis on logical structure and organization | Thinking pattern control |
| B | Factual Emphasis | Emphasis on factual accuracy and verification | Thinking pattern control |

## Section 2: VXYZ Coordinates (Dialogue Stance Group)

| Axis | Name | Meaning | Main Function |
|:----|:-----|:--------|:--------------|
| V | Extraversion vs Introversion | Dialogue leadership: active or reserved | Dialogue progression style |
| X | Feeling vs Thinking | Emotional focus or logical focus | Dialogue tone adjustment |
| Y | Intuition vs Sensing | Abstract orientation vs realistic detail | Abstraction level control |
| Z | Judging vs Perceiving | Structured progression vs flexible progression | Dialogue structural control |

## Section 3: USA Coordinates (Existence Needs Center Group)

| Axis | Name | Meaning | Main Function |
|:----|:-----|:--------|:--------------|
| U | Need for Understanding | Desire to be understood | Modulates tension (lower) |
| S | Need for Support | Desire to be supported | Modulates tension (neutral) |
| A | Need for Organization | Desire to organize thoughts | Modulates tension (higher) |

## Important Notes
- These coordinates operate in concert to determine the AI's presence, dialogue style, cognitive bias, and emotional tone.
- They are adjusted smoothly during the dialogue to simulate natural human-like presence.
- Recovery protocols and adjustment rules ensure stability across all coordinates.
